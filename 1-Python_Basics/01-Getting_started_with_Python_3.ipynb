    "    \n",
    "* sleek, readable syntax\n",
    "    * uses indents not { } to identify code blocks\n",
    "    * end of line is end of statement, no ; required\n",
    "    * tab/space wars: 4 spaces (but PyCharm and other IDEs fix tabs for you)\n",
    "    * underscore/camelCase wars: underscore preferred for variable names, camelCase for Objects\n",
    "    * case sensitive\n",
